**A**. Clear evidence from well-conducted, generalizable randomized controlled trials that are adequately powered, including: Evidence from a well-conducted multicenter trial, Evidence from a meta-analysis that incorporated quality ratings in the analysis, Compelling nonexperimental evidence, i.e., “all or none” rule developed by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford, Supportive evidence from well-conducted randomized controlled trials that are adequately powered, including: Evidence from a well-conducted trial at one or more institutions, Evidence from a meta-analysis that incorporated quality ratings in the analysis
